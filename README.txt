# QR Code Scanner
It seems there might be a challenge arising from either my PC camera or the prevailing lighting conditions, introducing potential difficulties, especially considering that I am currently utilizing a HUAWEI laptop. Despite the device, the converted image appears as a grayscale rendition, resembling a rabbit hole. I managed to successfully scan 2-3 barcodes, but the process has proven to be somewhat challenging.

The primary objective was initially to investigate the feasibility of substituting traditional scanners in warehouse environments, turning it into more of an experimental undertaking.

## Overview
