# QR Code Scanner
It appears there is an issue with either my PC camera or the lighting conditions, potentially causing difficulties. I was able to make it work for successfully scanning 2-3 barcodes. However, the process becomes quite challenging. The initial intent was to explore the possibility of replacing traditional scanners in warehouses, making it more of an experimental endeavor.

## Overview
This is a simple QR code scanner application implemented in Python using OpenCV and Tkinter.

## Features
- Recognizes QR codes using either the ZBar or ZXing library.
- Displays real-time video feed from the camera.
- Allows users to adjust camera settings and recognition options.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Tkinter
- ZBar (optional, for ZBar library)
- ZXing (optional, for ZXing library)
